### Project description
The project focuses on the decision-making workflow behind the use of mathematical models to make informed answers about a problem at hand.
In the case of our project, we faced a **supervised binary classification** problem of predicting the overall customer satisfaction based on several features - objective measures of satisfaction provided by customers of the anonymized *Invistico Airlines*.

We attempt to build a classification model that is both:
* Accurate in it's predictions
* Explainable - to help guide the company actions to maximize the number of satisfied customers
